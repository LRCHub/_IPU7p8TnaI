# ゴールデンボンバー – ウジ虫

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Someone has twitted "I hate you already"
What the heck has she seen, I have no idea at all
Public eye is looking for my faults today as well
To be honest, facing it, I want to commit suicidal action
Or attempt a suicide

I wanted to become famous, why, I wonder
When I'm bound hand and foot so hard

To disappear without anyone noticing
I understand that I hate it but
It's painful, bitter, and in such evenings
I think that I want some being near me to cuddle with

Maybe there isn't such thing as easy job anywhere
If you look, everyone is spitting out dissatisfaction only

This is a convenient world, so why, I wonder
My heart is worn out like this

Words of some unknown person
Strangely remain inside, and still worry me a little
If I got through with "It can't be helped"
How much easier it would be, I wonder.
Is it also what is called "the price of fame"? orz

I've sacrificed various things, but
Now that I try to live, my throat gets dry every day at random...

If I could vanish without anyone noticing
It's an evening when this thought crosses my mind so
Such full of desires and ugly me,
Please, please, spoil me please

No, no, I don't want to vanish
Be near me, let's get closer

Are you alive? Are you okay? Are you near me?
